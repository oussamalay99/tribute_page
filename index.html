                <p>Even his efforts in realizing his co-invention of the lithium-ion battery which was honoured with the 2019 Noble Prize in Chemistry, Yazami was unfortunately ommited from the award due to Noble Prize's limitation of up to three recipients
                    which was given to his colleagues Stanley Whittingham, John Goodenough and Akira Yoshino.</p>
